    <h4>
      <strong>Sports</strong>. You <em>love</em> being an
      <strong>athlete</strong>.&#127939; But...
    </h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Training</strong> for a <strong>competition</strong>, whether
      it&apos;s a <strong>(half-) marathon</strong>, <strong>triathlon</strong>,
      <strong>bike or swimming event</strong>, is <em>exhilarating</em> and
      makes you feel <em>alive</em>. <br />
      But balancing a <em>demanding</em> <strong>9-5 job</strong>,
      <em>intense</em> <strong>training</strong>, and
      <strong>preparing nutritious meals</strong>, all while trying to get a
      solid 8 hours of sleep, can feel <em>absolutely</em> overwhelming. <br />
      You know that to <strong>train hard</strong> and
      <strong>perform at your best </strong>, you <em>need</em> to fuel your
      body with the <em>right</em> nutrients. But how can you possibly fit that
      all in your day??&#128560;
      <br />
      <br />
      Waking up even earlier &#9200; to cook a filling meal isn't an option.
      You're already <em>exhausted</em> just thinking about it. <br />
      And after a <em>long</em>, gruelling <strong>day at work</strong> the
      <em>last</em> thing you want to do is create a <em>massive mess</em> in
      the <strong>kitchen</strong> and spend hours cleaning it up.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, you take the easy way out, either getting a
      <em>super expensive</em> takeout <strong>lunch</strong> or just eating the
      same <em>boring</em> easy-to-prep <strong>lunch</strong> day after day<br />
      —whether it&apos;s a muesli, salad, or sandwich. Initially, this might
      seem manageable, but soon, the negatives outweigh the positives…
      <br />
      <br />
      Before long, you realise your <strong>routine lunch</strong> isn&apos;t
      recharging you anymore. You dread it because it's <em>boring</em> and
      <em>uninspiring</em>. <br />
      The hours at work drag on and on and on, and suddenly you find yourself
      <strong>lacking the energy</strong> you desperately need for your
      <strong>workouts</strong> as well as for the rest of your day. &#128532;
    </p>

    <h4>The good news &#128161;:</h4>

    <p>
      There's a simple approach to boost your energy levels at lunch time and
      get you back to your peak performance in training sessions.
      <br />
      <br />
      Here it comes:
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Meal prep</strong>, <strong>meal prep</strong> and again… <br />
      <strong>Meal prep</strong>. - It may sound daunting, but actually is a
      real game-changer!
      <br />
      <br />
      It&apos;ll <em>shock</em> you how <em>much</em> of a
      <em>positive impact </em> <strong>regular lunch meal prepping</strong> can
      have on your day-to-day life.
    </p>

    <h4>You'll:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be more <strong>energised</strong> after <strong>lunchtime</strong>, so
        you can stay <strong>focused</strong>, work up to that
        <em>dream promotion</em>, and get to your <em>dream pace</em>. &#128640;
      </li>
      <li>
        Eat <strong>healthier</strong> overall through eating
        <strong>planned meals</strong>. This will maximise your
        <strong>muscle-building ability</strong> and therefore help you
        <em>tremendously</em> in <strong>preventing injuries</strong>. &#127808;
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce stress, because you don't have to think about what to eat every
        day, making you feel way more <em>relaxed</em> and
        <strong>prevents mental overload</strong>. &#128173;
      </li>
      <li>
        Spend <em>less money</em> on <strong>takeout lunches</strong> and have a
        bigger budget for vacations and adventures. &#127965;&#127956;
      </li>

      <li>
        Spend <em>less time</em> <strong>cooking</strong> in the evenings and
        more time on hobbies, with your family, partner, and with friends.
        &#128588;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Overall, you'll feel <em>more joy</em> while
      <strong>working and training</strong> because
      <strong>feeling good in your body</strong> translates to feeling even
      better in your mind.😊

    <h4>
      Now, let me introduce myself and share with you this awesome
      <strong>strategy</strong>.
    </h4>

    <img

      alt="A picture of me 10 minutes before the start of my first marathon in rome"
    />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Hi &#128075;, I&apos;m Lenny, and I&apos;m a <strong>runner</strong> from
      Heidelberg &#127984;, Germany.
      <br />
      <br />
      Why do I <strong>love running</strong>? While climbing the corporate
      marketing ladder in New Zealand, burnout loomed over me. <br />
      Working Monday to Saturday and trying to somehow make it through to my
      yearly annual holidays, I lost all my purpose in life.
      <br />
      <br />
      Until, after a long time, I spontaneously decided to
      <strong>go on a run</strong> again… <br />
      Shout out to my awesome girlfriend for that! &#123922;
      <br />
      <br />
      And there it was, this simple, but incredibly powerful feeling of freedom.
      I felt like I could just go anywhere and do anything. <br />
      <strong>Running half-marathons and marathons</strong> would become my new
      purpose. &#129321;
      <br />
      <br />
      But as you might have experienced firsthand yourself,
      <em>soon</em> the first setbacks would come around. Injuries and bad
      performances made me doubt myself. &#129301; <br />
      Little did I know that <strong>good nutrition</strong> is the key to
      consistently <strong>train</strong> and get the
      <strong>race results</strong> you want. <br />
      About one and a half years ago, I finally discovered the
      <em>transformative power</em> of a
      <strong>nutritious and balanced lunch</strong>.
      <br />
      <br />
      We have an awesome saying here in Germany that brings it straight to the
      point - and yes, it&apos;s not about getting drunk in a beer tent -
      &#128579;, "Du bist, was du isst," <br />
      which translates to "You are what you eat". This principle has become the
      cornerstone of my own <strong>training and lifestyle</strong>, and it has
      absolutely proven to be <em>correct</em>. <br />
      I couldn't believe how much it would not only
      <strong>improve my performance</strong>, but also how much better I would
      feel while running. <br />
      Just imagine starting your <strong>training sessions</strong>
      <strong>feeling perfectly energised</strong>—<strong>not too full</strong
      >, <strong>not too hungry</strong>. <br />
      <em>Flying</em> through those <strong>workouts</strong>, pushing your body
      <em>further than ever</em>. This is the
      <strong>power of proper nutrition</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>&#127947; Yes, you can do it, too!</h4>

    <p>
      Inspired by my own results, I&apos;ve created three
      <strong>easy to prepare recipes</strong> to help fellow
      <strong>active 9-5 professionals</strong> who are tired of dull,
      <strong>unenergising lunches</strong> <br />
      <strong>achieve maximum performance</strong> <strong>at work</strong> and
      in their <strong>workouts</strong>. &#128267; <br />
      By implementing this
      <strong
        >weekly recipe routine with two-hour meal preps on the weekend</strong
      >, you can enjoy
      <strong
        >healthy, delicious and filling lunches <br />
        that fuel your day, as well as your training sessions</strong
      >.
      <br />
      <br />
      But, hold on. I don&apos;t have the time to spend my weekends making a
      <em>massive mess</em> in my <strong>kitchen</strong>?? <br />
      Don&apos;t worry, you won&apos;t have to go on any weird diets,
      <strong>cook</strong> for five hours on the weekend or need a massive
      freezer to make this happen.
      <br />
      <br />
      Done correctly this will actually
      <em>save you a lot of time and stress</em>! <br />
      The most common reason why people fail at
      <strong
        >eating consistently healthy lunches and meal prepping them on the
        weekend</strong
      >
      is that <em>they make it too complicated</em>. <br />
      <em>So why not keep it simple</em>? <br />
    </p>

    <h4>
      Here's how to keep it <em>super</em> <strong>simple</strong> in
      <strong>three easy steps</strong> when <strong>meal prepping</strong>:
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan your meals</strong> &#128197;: <br />
        Since you'll need five lunches for the five days you work per week, you
        only have to prep two big batches. For the last day you
        <strong>plan a lunch</strong> <br />
        which won&apos;t require precooking and can be put into your lunch box
        in less then five minutes in the morning, e.g. a poke bowl, muesli with
        fruit salad and nuts, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a <strong>grocery list</strong> and
        <strong>go grocery shopping</strong> 🛍: <br />
        This is also a great way to <em>avoid</em> food waste! Make sure to
        <strong>plan your grocery shop</strong> well in advance if you live in
        Germany like me since Sundays everything is closed. &#128579;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan your cooking time</strong> on Sunday, put on some music,
        pour yourself your favourite bevy and let the
        <strong>chopping</strong> begin!🍳<br />
        Make sure you allow approx. 52 minutes per meal + clean up. So your
        usual meal prep shouldn't take longer than 1 hour and 44 minutes. <br />
        And most importantly <strong>have lots of fun while cooking</strong>!
      </li>
    </ul>

      You've been patiently waiting long enough…
      <br />

      Here are <strong>three healthy and powerful meal prep ideas</strong> to

      >
      &#128523;: <br />
      To keep it at an <strong>easy budget</strong>, I&apos;ve decided to make
      all <strong>recipes</strong> <strong>vegetarian</strong>. If you prefer
      eating meat, definitely feel free to
      <strong>use quality, organic meat from your local farmer</strong> instead.
      <br />
      &dash; Also, to make it <strong>interesting</strong>, each one of these
      <strong>recipes</strong> originates from a different country.
