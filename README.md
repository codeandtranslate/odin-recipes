Odin-Recipes-Project: Mouthwatering recipes that will make your work stress disappear at lunchtime

This is going to be my first proper web-devolpement project.

In this project I'm going to build a basic recipe website.
The website is going to consist of a main homepage including links to various recipes.

The goal of this project is to build a very solid HTML skillset 
while simontaniousley practicing to commit early and often! 
I'm also going to focus on writing good, conventional and atomic 
commits. 
Most likeley, it won't look pretty, but as described above this 
isn't the goal of this project for now.
It'll be possible later on to make the whole website prettier with CSS.

I chose to niche down for lunch recipes and use the following marketing slogan: A lunch so delicious it'll make your work stress fly away.
I believe, it's a lucrative niche with a great potential for high-paying clients.
