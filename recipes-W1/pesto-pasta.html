    <h2>When does this <strong>recipe</strong> work best?</h2>

    <p>
      Before/ after <strong>Speed sessions</strong> and here is why: Interval
      training and speed sessions are high-intensity workouts that require quick
      bursts of energy. <br />
      The <strong>Pesto Pasta Salad</strong>, with its high carbohydrate
      content, is ideal for fuelling these workouts. <br />
      The <strong>pasta</strong> provides
      <strong>easily accessible energy</strong> that can be rapidly used by the
      body during intense efforts. <br />
      The moderate <strong>protein content</strong> also helps with muscle
      repair, while the <strong>fats keep you satiated and energised </strong>
      <em>without</em> being too heavy on the stomach.
