      5 more steps left until you'll have an unforgettable lunch prepared!
    </h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Chopping timeeee: Chop the garlic cloves and onion like they've never
        seen a knife before.
        <ol>
          <li>Drain the corn, beans and tomato cans</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the beautiful sauce:
        <ol>
          <li>Heat the oil in a big pan.</li>
          <li>
            Add the chopped garlic and onion and let them sizzle for a bit.
          </li>
          <li>Add the drained corn, beans, and tomatoes.</li>
          <li>Add some salt and pepper to taste.</li>
          <li>
            **Optional: Cut and add a chilly 2.5 Let it simmer until cooked.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Vamos, let's make some guacamole!
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cut the avocados in half, remove the seed and scoop out the flesh
            into a medium-sized bowl.
          </li>
          <li>Add some salt, pepper and lime juice.</li>
          <li>
            Now, mix and smash them like they've never seen a fork before!!...
            not too much though because you still want to have a few little
            chunks in there.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it cool down and store both in separate containers in your fridge.
      </li>
      <li>
        All you need to do when packing your lunch in the morning:
        <ol>
          <li>Layer your lunch box with a good amount of corn chips.</li>
          <li>
            Add the sauce and sprinkle a generous amount of cheese on top.
          </li>
          <li>Put a good amount of guacamole in a second lunch container.</li>
          <li>
            Then you can either put it into the microwave now and eat it cool
            later, or heat it at work if you have one there.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
